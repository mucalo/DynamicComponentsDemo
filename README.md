This is a demo project to go with a blog post on my blog: https://mariomucalo.com/dynamic-components-in-blazor-with-parameters-and-event-handling/

The demo shows:

- how to use `DynamicComponent` in Blazor
- how to pass parameters to a `DynamicComponent`
- how to do event handling with `DynamicComponent`
- how to avoid magic strings for parameters and events 
- how to make use of the compiler to make your life more practical when dealing with `DynamicComponent`
